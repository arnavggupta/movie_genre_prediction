MOVIE GENERE PREDICTION
OVERVIEW :- This project explores the prediction of movie genres from subtitle scripts using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for multi-label classification. The project utilizes movie subtitle data in the \texttt{.srt} format, with text preprocessing steps including tokenization, stopword removal, and sequence padding. Feature extraction is performed using Keras's \texttt{Tokenizer} for converting the text into integer sequences, followed by multi-label binarization of genre labels. The model is trained using a combination of LSTM layers and dense layers, resulting in genre predictions that account for multiple genres simultaneously. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset of movie subtitles, achieving accurate and reliable genre predictions. The findings suggest that LSTM-based models are well-suited for subtitle-based genre prediction, and the paper concludes with suggestions for future improvements, such as experimenting with additional deep learning architectures and incorporating more sophisticated feature extraction methods.
