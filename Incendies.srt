1
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:07,255
I'm glad to see you.

2
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,576
Please.

3
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THE TWINS

4
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,826
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,267
Opening of the will to
her two children,

6
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:55,330
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,778
"In accordance with the will,

8
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:02,780
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

9
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,850
the notary, Jean Lebel,

10
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,045
is named executor."

11
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:10,315
Hmm ... I must tell you here

12
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,288
that it was your mother's decision.

13
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:17,693
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

14
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,991
You know ...

15
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,161
... your mother was more
than an employee.

16
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,635
To my late wife and me

17
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,039
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

18
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,568
I could not refuse.

19
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,314
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

20
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,715
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

21
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,083
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

22
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,521
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

23
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:48,188
"Burial"

24
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,592
"Notary Jean Lebel will

25
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,996
bury me without a coffin, naked

26
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,329
and without prayers."

27
00:05:56,436 --> 00:06:00,497
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

28
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:06,173
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

29
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,204
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

30
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,713
and my name engraved nowhere."

31
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,114
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

32
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,521
"To Jeanne and Simon"

33
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,923
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

34
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,393
which cannot be removed easily."

35
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,133
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

36
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:35,400
"This envelope is for your father."

37
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,374
"Find him

38
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,309
and hand him the envelope."

39
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,116
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

40
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,742
I've heard enough.

41
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,892
Oh ... but it's not finished.

42
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,818
Continue.

43
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,457
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

44
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,570
"This envelope is for your brother."

45
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,340
"Find him and hand it to him."

46
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,615
"When these envelopes
have been handed

47
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:20,446
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

48
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,521
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

49
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,819
a stone may be placed
on my grave

50
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,020
and my name engraved on
the stone."

51
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,011
I admit it's a bit strange.

52
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,379
Is there stuff to sign?

53
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,650
No, not today.

54
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,020
OK.

55
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,654
Thank you, Jean.

56
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,319
- Shall we?
- Wait.

57
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,864
You know, the history
of our father.

58
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,302
You know, we have no brother.

59
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,738
Why did you let her write this?

60
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:19,202
I understand your surprise.

61
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,575
It's ... it's very surprising.

62
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:22,681
Stop pretending to be innocent!

63
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,374
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

64
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,748
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

65
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,184
They are part of a will.

66
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:31,847
There's that, too.

67
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:52,534
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

68
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,239
We'll sleep on it, then ...

69
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,246
We'll meet again, huh?

70
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,851
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

71
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,887
Sit down, Simon.

72
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,751
Look, Jean ...

73
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,587
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

74
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:12,359
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

75
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,695
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

76
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,565
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

77
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,761
Simon ...

78
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,396
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

79
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:24,134
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

80
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,869
For once in your fucking life

81
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,072
make it something normal.

82
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,439
This is not negotiable.

83
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,663
Take your time.

84
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,427
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

85
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,934
I know it's very unusual, but ...

86
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,936
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

87
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,326
We have a large family now.

88
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,540
She spoke of a traitor?

89
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,270
In a big family, there's always a dog.

90
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,006
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

91
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,706
Fucking crazy woman!

92
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,284
I'll fix that with Jean.

93
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,824
Fix what?

94
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,520
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

95
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,668
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

96
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,883
Where are you going?

97
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,178
You bury her any way you like!

98
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,843
Oh, stop!

99
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,180
You feel guilty because
you were not there

100
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,325
when she died.

101
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,256
You feel guilty because
you were there

102
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,691
when she had her accident.

103
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,387
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

104
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:27,226
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

105
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,858
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

106
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,196
Well, she's gone!

107
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,237
It's over, I'm at peace!

108
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,004
I have fucking peace!

109
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,243
I'm at peace now.

110
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,516
Yes, I see.

111
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:59,595
Mathematics as you
have known so far

112
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,691
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

113
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,738
to precise and definitive problems.

114
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,364
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

115
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,967
The subject will be
intractable problems

116
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:14,704
that will always lead

117
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,749
to other problems just
as intractable.

118
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,613
People around you will
repeatedly insist

119
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,745
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

120
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,915
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

121
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,824
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity.

122
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,165
Welcome to pure mathematics,

123
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,291
the land of loneliness.

124
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,428
This is my assistant,

125
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,403
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

126
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,932
Hello!

127
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,978
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

128
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,287
What does your intuition
tell you?

129
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,293
Your intuition is always right.

130
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,659
That's why you got potential

131
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,199
to becoming a real mathematician.

132
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,963
But over there, you'll need help.

133
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,130
Do you have any family there?

134
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,338
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

135
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:23,006
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

136
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,208
and b) you have another brother.

137
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,443
This is ridiculous

138
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,953
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

139
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,546
You need to know.

140
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,220
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

141
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,893
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

142
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,630
You need a starting point.

143
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,677
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

144
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,044
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

145
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,175
You never start with the
unknown variable.

146
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,053
My mother used to speak about
a village

147
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,021
called Der Om, in Fouad.

148
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,524
She graduated in French

149
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,026
at the University of Daresh.

150
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:14,099
If she studied, there is hope.

151
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,193
Said Haidar.

152
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:20,931
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

153
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,507
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

154
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,543
You can trust him.

155
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,450
What are you doing?

156
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,683
Mom! Are you Okay?

157
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,562
Madam, that's my towel, please.

158
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,389
Mom?

159
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,369
Mom!

160
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,251
Mom?

161
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:06,821
What happened?

162
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,935
Where's Jeanne?

163
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,429
Mom?

164
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,648
Does she suffer from migraines?

165
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:30,778
No.

166
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,084
- Memory loss?
- No.

167
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,353
Loss of balance?

168
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:36,518
No.

169
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,254
Absent-minded?

170
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:40,332
She's always absent.

171
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,866
No, she was never absent.

172
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,367
Wahab, come.

173
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,064
Just get out of my sister's way.

174
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,294
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

175
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,143
Nicolas, stop!

176
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,738
Go back to your country.

177
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:36,879
Wahab!

178
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:40,543
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

179
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,276
Give me.

180
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,822
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

181
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,257
You have sullied the
family honor.

182
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:50,827
- Enough!

183
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,660
Go home!

184
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,598
Go home!

185
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,573
Outside.

186
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,474
What have you done!

187
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:17,088
You have humilliated us!
You have sullied the
name of our family!

188
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,985
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

189
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:27,129
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

190
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,166
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

191
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,265
I'm pregnant, grandma.

192
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:38,469
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

193
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,839
Why have you done this?

194
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,845
Do I have to kill you?

195
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,984
What will I do with you?

196
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,794
Come.

197
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,431
Eat if you want your
child safe.

198
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,606
Listen to me.

199
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,774
There's nothing here for you.

200
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,878
I'll help after the birth.

201
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,146
I want you to go away.

202
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:35,659
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

203
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,960
There, you'll go to school.

204
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,328
To learn to read,
to learn to think

205
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,560
out of this misery.

206
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,503
Promise me and I'll help you.

207
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,939
Promise me you'll go to school.

208
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,015
I promise you, grandmother.

209
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,821
I promise.

210
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,572
Shh.

211
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,322
Shh.

212
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:52,312
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

213
00:26:55,527 --> 00:27:01,762
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

214
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:15,003
Be careful.
Don't worry.

215
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:51,182
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

216
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,310
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

217
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:14,837
One day I'll find you, my son.

218
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,338
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

219
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,533
but I can't help you

220
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,644
because at the time,

221
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:00,972
I taught

222
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:04,480
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

223
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,516
Specifically, the period

224
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:11,611
where Euler had
succeeded

225
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,657
to give the first

226
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,988
formal mathematical resolution

227
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:21,861
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

228
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,992
Diderot defied the Court

229
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,037
saying:

230
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:28,230
"Gentlemen ..."

231
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:32,002
I-ft plus

232
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,508
Equals zero.

233
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,674
So, God exists!"

234
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,182
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

235
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,261
Hello! Do you speak French?

236
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,267
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

237
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:03,067
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

238
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,034
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

239
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,604
Are you kidding me?

240
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:11,909
I wasn't even born.

241
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,211
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

242
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,512
I'm not kidding.

243
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,679
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

244
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,347
I have come from far away.

245
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:22,119
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

246
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:32,730
You are very kind.

247
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,704
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

248
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,366
Najat, that's me.

249
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,973
You have time to waste?

250
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:43,580
That tells me something.

251
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:48,118
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

252
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:50,644
It's been a long time.

253
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,251
People who leave usually
change identities.

254
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,932
It is striking nonetheless.

255
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,408
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

256
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,005
Look here.

257
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:23,310
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

258
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,257
It is a prison in the south.

259
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,456
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

260
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:34,622
- No.

261
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,200
You're definitely not from
here.

262
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:42,304
You don't know the South.

263
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,300
If the international community

264
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,204
does not intervene now

265
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,205
The refugees in overcrowded

266
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,244
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

267
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,048
She has arrived.

268
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,319
OK.

269
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,192
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

270
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,697
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

271
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,197
The National Party supports

272
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,892
militias of the Christian right,

273
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,936
who make open threats against
the refugees.

274
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,063
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

275
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,004
And have the support

276
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:55,409
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

277
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:58,744
But you ...you're a Christian.

278
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:01,374
We are for peace.

279
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,885
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

280
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,463
Nawal!

281
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,724
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

282
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,564
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

283
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,750
Nawal, come back.

284
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,217
Stay here.

285
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,819
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

286
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,794
There will be clashes.

287
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,129
Stay with me.

288
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,015
There is shooting outside ...

289
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,919
To the table, girls!

290
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,959
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

291
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,826
It's not a reason not to eat!

292
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,297
Aioua?

293
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:03,804
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

294
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,068
May God protect us!

295
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,235
That's why they closed
the university.

296
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:11,746
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

297
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,220
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

298
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,680
For how long?

299
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,417
We start tomorrow.

300
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,358
The rest of the family
is already there.

301
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,020
And the school?

302
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,532
Anyway, the school will close.

303
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,003
Only God knows how long.

304
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,766
And Le Journal?

305
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,097
Don't be afraid.

306
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:40,676
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

307
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,539
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

308
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,513
Exactly, Rafqa.

309
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,177
Exactly.

310
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:03,394
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

311
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,400
I will join you soon.

312
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,731
You will not go there now!

313
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,905
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

314
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,600
You heard your father.

315
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,771
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

316
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,249
The studies are finished.

317
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,582
I think of him every day.

318
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,418
That's my child.

319
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,389
I want to find him alive.

320
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,984
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

321
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,416
Hurry, Nawal.

322
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,570
- Your name?
- Nawal.

323
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,074
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

324
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,072
Where are you going?

325
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,447
South.

326
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,603
What for?

327
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,112
To meet my husband.

328
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,559
Wahab.

329
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,655
You have only daughters?

330
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,091
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

331
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:08,726
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

332
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:42,215
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

333
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:43,859
There.

334
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,764
The children?
Where are the children?

335
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:51,098
You should speak with those
who were there.

336
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:56,672
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

337
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,768
They fear reprisals will come.

338
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,339
The children may be with them.

339
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:11,451
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

340
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:17,288
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

341
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,813
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

342
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:47,356
I am a Christian.

343
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,930
My daughter! My daughter!

344
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:09,974
Mom!

345
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:39,587
Hi, Simon, it's me!

346
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,487
I am in Mama's village.

347
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,422
I wish you were here with me.

348
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:44,459
Listen.

349
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:09,650
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

350
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,483
I told you never to come here again!

351
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:50,815
Hello!

352
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,151
Souha?

353
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,669
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

354
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,101
I told you not to say that again!

355
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:10,835
Hello.

356
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:12,406
Can I help you?

357
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,387
Hello.

358
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:23,189
Does anyone speak French
or English?

359
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,555
Where's Sami?

360
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,228
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

361
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:39,299
Hello!
Hello!

362
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,432
Hello!

363
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,569
(Arabic)

364
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,155
Uh, Jeanne.

365
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:54,961
Jeanne.

366
00:56:58,602 --> 00:56:59,933
Jeanne.

367
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:03,270
Uh ...

368
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:08,900
Thank you.

369
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:27,919
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!

370
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,430
Hello.

371
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,001
My name is Samia.

372
00:57:32,135 --> 00:57:34,433
I am Jeanne Marwan.

373
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:35,937
Thank you for helping me.

374
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,475
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.

375
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:41,133
Really?

376
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:44,639
Well, I'm from Canada.

377
00:57:45,682 --> 00:57:47,650
I'm looking for Souha.

378
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,945
She is Souha.

379
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:52,783
She is my great-grandmother.

380
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:55,483
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.

381
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:05,196
The people in the corner shop
told me to come see you.

382
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:13,234
I am looking for my father.

383
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:15,038
His name is Wahab.

384
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:24,082
Uh ...My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

385
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:27,049
She was born here.

386
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:36,555
We do not know her.

387
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:39,258
Of course you know her.

388
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,840
The Marwan family was struck with
shame.

389
00:59:06,863 --> 00:59:08,854
When the war came.

390
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,136
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.

391
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,878
She does not know Wahab.

392
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:30,882
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

393
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:43,923
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter,

394
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:48,128
you're not welcome here.

395
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:49,761
Go home.

396
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:56,176
She is looking for her father,

397
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,144
but she doesn't know
who is her mother.

398
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:36,231
<i>I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the Deressa refugee camp.

399
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:39,608
<i>Everything was burning.

400
01:02:41,478 --> 01:02:44,311
<i>I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.

401
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:49,146
<i>I was disheartened by what I saw
and heard.

402
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:52,583
You claim to be against
our enemy.

403
01:02:53,323 --> 01:02:56,520
That does not make you our friend.

404
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:00,588
Chamseddine. why would
he trust you?

405
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,163
My son's father was
a refugee from Deressa.

406
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:06,302
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

407
01:03:07,837 --> 01:03:09,964
I have nothing to lose.

408
01:03:11,841 --> 01:03:14,867
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

409
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:19,311
This is not what you wrote
in Charbel's journal.

410
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:24,877
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage
peace with words and books.

411
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:28,014
I believed that.

412
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:32,358
Life has taught me
something else.

413
01:03:35,165 --> 01:03:36,962
What are you going to do now?

414
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:43,198
Teach the enemy what
life has taught me.

415
01:04:37,227 --> 01:04:39,388
That's goog. That's good.

416
01:04:39,562 --> 01:04:42,395
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.

417
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:49,100
So in French?

418
01:04:50,573 --> 01:04:53,235
I ... I am much better, Dad.

419
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,877
They say "a lot" or "best"

420
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:57,708
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

421
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:03,381
I want my son to learn to speak
several languages.

422
01:05:03,553 --> 01:05:06,420
I want him to understand others
without an intermediary.

423
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,511
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.

424
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:40,019
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

425
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,990
My mother is very well.
10:00 o'clock tomorrow.

426
01:05:46,096 --> 01:05:47,791
Tomorrow.

427
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:38,837
Marhaba.

428
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,998
Hello, beautiful.

429
01:07:05,175 --> 01:07:06,267
Good morning.

430
01:07:06,709 --> 01:07:08,438
Then you will be going out
with us on Thursday?

431
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:09,600
No.

432
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,212
Friday?

433
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:12,439
No.

434
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:13,547
Saturday?

435
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:15,013
No.

436
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:18,713
We are patient!

437
01:07:18,922 --> 01:07:20,355
Me too.

438
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,237
Never forget:

439
01:07:35,405 --> 01:07:37,396
"Always" is "always".

440
01:08:39,602 --> 01:08:40,591
Fucking bitch.

441
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:25,734
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was comdemmed in

442
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:28,775
several reports by Amnesty
International.

443
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,388
Here is the women's section.

444
01:10:40,957 --> 01:10:42,618
The cells are larger.

445
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:45,922
Some prisoners remained
there up to 15 years.

446
01:10:55,438 --> 01:10:58,771
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.

447
01:10:58,908 --> 01:11:00,739
Just after the war began.

448
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:03,573
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

449
01:11:06,315 --> 01:11:07,646
You can come in, eh?

450
01:11:07,784 --> 01:11:09,308
I'll take a picture.

451
01:11:21,297 --> 01:11:23,026
You know this woman?

452
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:24,933
No.

453
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:27,264
She was imprisoned here.

454
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:30,196
I don't know her.

455
01:11:30,339 --> 01:11:32,500
It was a really long time
ago, you know? I...

456
01:11:32,642 --> 01:11:35,611
Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

457
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:16,813
Hello.

458
01:12:24,026 --> 01:12:25,220
Hello.

459
01:12:28,598 --> 01:12:31,032
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.

460
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:37,696
I am the school janitor.

461
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,740
Yes, but before, what were you?

462
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:42,276
Before, hum!

463
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:45,278
That was before I became the
school janitor.

464
01:12:45,414 --> 01:12:48,713
It's been a long time since I'm
caretaker of the school.

465
01:12:50,953 --> 01:12:52,887
You know this woman?

466
01:12:53,055 --> 01:12:54,682
She was in Kfar Ryat.

467
01:12:57,627 --> 01:13:00,892
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.

468
01:13:03,966 --> 01:13:06,093
I am looking for someone
who knew her.

469
01:13:06,235 --> 01:13:08,703
Someone who could
tell me about her.

470
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,707
This is my mother.

471
01:13:15,912 --> 01:13:18,779
This is the woman who sings.

472
01:13:18,915 --> 01:13:20,041
Number 72.

473
01:13:22,218 --> 01:13:24,652
It was she who murdered the
militia leader

474
01:13:24,787 --> 01:13:26,254
of the christian right.

475
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:29,617
They made her pay dearly.

476
01:13:29,759 --> 01:13:32,592
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.

477
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,500
They used to call her the
woman who sings

478
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:41,796
because she sang all the time.

479
01:13:42,905 --> 01:13:44,930
Han, you are sure it's her?

480
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:48,841
I spent 13 years as a watchman.

481
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,447
Have you ever spent 13 years
overseeing someone?

482
01:13:58,421 --> 01:14:00,981
They did everything
to make her break.

483
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:06,686
In the end, she was
still standing,

484
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:08,922
She looked ...

485
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:11,797
Ah! Never seen anything like it.

486
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:14,300
She never broke.

487
01:14:14,437 --> 01:14:17,270
It was exasperating.

488
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,142
And then they sent Abu Tarek.

489
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:28,305
Who's that?

490
01:14:38,394 --> 01:14:40,521
Abu Tarek...

491
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:45,223
You know, sometimes it's better

492
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:47,893
not to know everything.

493
01:14:48,037 --> 01:14:50,005
Sir, I live with it anyway.

494
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,497
Continue.

495
01:14:54,043 --> 01:14:55,237
Abu Tarek...

496
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:00,171
Abu Tarek was a investigation
specialist.

497
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:02,510
He raped her repeatedly

498
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:05,586
to break her before being
released.

499
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:08,519
To stop her from singing.

500
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:15,690
Eventually she became pregnant.

501
01:15:17,266 --> 01:15:19,200
It was like that.

502
01:15:19,368 --> 01:15:21,529
I'll never forget it.

503
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:25,162
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

504
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:28,703
They waited ...

505
01:15:28,844 --> 01:15:31,335
for her to give birth in prison

506
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:34,416
then they let her go.

507
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,518
The child?
Did you see the child?

508
01:15:42,725 --> 01:15:46,126
There was a doctor who came
sometimes.

509
01:15:47,129 --> 01:15:49,222
I think he's crazy.

510
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:52,731
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

511
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,403
That's bullshit.

512
01:15:56,539 --> 01:15:59,235
He went mad and died.

513
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:02,775
His nurse, I know her.

514
01:16:02,912 --> 01:16:05,073
She lives in Daresh.

515
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:09,607
In Daresh?

516
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,659
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!

517
01:16:19,795 --> 01:16:22,992
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

518
01:16:23,132 --> 01:16:25,623
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

519
01:16:26,902 --> 01:16:28,767
Mom, she was raped.

520
01:16:30,272 --> 01:16:32,331
Our brother, she had him in prison.

521
01:16:34,143 --> 01:16:36,008
I need you here.

522
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,940
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS

523
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:38,624
This, Simon, are notary Amyott
contracts

524
01:19:38,794 --> 01:19:39,783
from 1868 to 1892.

525
01:19:39,929 --> 01:19:43,262
His son took over, Édouard,
until 1925.

526
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,697
All the contracts are hand-written.

527
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:48,598
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

528
01:19:48,704 --> 01:19:50,171
And me.

529
01:19:50,306 --> 01:19:53,002
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

530
01:19:53,142 --> 01:19:54,507
I am the last of the Lebel.

531
01:19:54,643 --> 01:19:57,043
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

532
01:19:59,982 --> 01:20:01,813
... which took several lives.

533
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,019
His heirs have discovered

534
01:20:06,155 --> 01:20:07,986
he had three wives, all
at the same time.

535
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:09,147
One here, one in Miami,

536
01:20:09,325 --> 01:20:11,987
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

537
01:20:13,395 --> 01:20:17,229
No, no ...he not longer has
three children in the file there, no

538
01:20:17,366 --> 01:20:18,333
There are eight.

539
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,695
That is sport, my man.

540
01:20:22,504 --> 01:20:24,369
Look. Hum!

541
01:20:26,408 --> 01:20:28,899
Death is never the
end of a story.

542
01:20:29,044 --> 01:20:30,739
There are still traces.

543
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:34,911
If you want to find
your brother,

544
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,484
you'll have to go back into
your mother's past.

545
01:20:37,586 --> 01:20:40,180
Jean, I'm going to fetch my
sister, that's all.

546
01:20:40,322 --> 01:20:41,254
I'll take care of that.

547
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,585
Two, three small matters
to take care,

548
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:45,193
then it will take no time.

549
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:47,090
Well, get your business ready

550
01:20:47,229 --> 01:20:48,491
we should go in ...

551
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:50,497
My passport ...

552
01:20:50,599 --> 01:20:54,035
"We"? Don't you worry that
you already done enough already

553
01:20:54,169 --> 01:20:57,366
Exactly, this is not the
time to let you down.

554
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:01,036
Make a man out of you, Simon.

555
01:21:01,176 --> 01:21:03,371
I know that you need me.

556
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,773
We'll get it, then come back.

557
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,281
I promise.

558
01:21:09,418 --> 01:21:11,443
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

559
01:21:11,587 --> 01:21:14,750
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

560
01:24:10,732 --> 01:24:12,859
Sing now.

561
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:22,034
Gently, gently.

562
01:25:24,172 --> 01:25:25,537
He is coming out.

563
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:27,340
We can see the head.

564
01:25:27,509 --> 01:25:28,874
Push, push.

565
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:31,103
Go, girl.

566
01:25:39,454 --> 01:25:41,046
The first came out.

567
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:05,241
Rest now ...

568
01:26:06,348 --> 01:26:07,713
I'm proud of you.

569
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:11,676
Get ready for the second.

570
01:26:41,116 --> 01:26:42,378
Stop.

571
01:26:42,617 --> 01:26:43,948
Stop.

572
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,052
What are you doing?

573
01:26:46,388 --> 01:26:48,618
You are going to dump them in the
river as usual.

574
01:26:50,425 --> 01:26:51,722
- It's dangerous.
- No.

575
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,796
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.

576
01:26:55,964 --> 01:26:57,591
I want to take care of them.

577
01:26:58,066 --> 01:27:00,626
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

578
01:27:20,622 --> 01:27:23,750
Oh, this country is a war
zone after another, eh!

579
01:27:23,925 --> 01:27:24,983
It's not complicated.

580
01:27:25,127 --> 01:27:27,618
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

581
01:27:27,763 --> 01:27:28,923
we would not be here.

582
01:27:29,064 --> 01:27:31,828
We need only to find the
original contracts.

583
01:27:31,967 --> 01:27:35,596
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

584
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:36,726
And we talk more about it.

585
01:27:36,838 --> 01:27:38,271
Everyone would be happy.

586
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,238
Notaries have existed
only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.

587
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:43,004
That's the problem.

588
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:45,272
I should have been here from
the beginning.

589
01:27:45,414 --> 01:27:48,144
Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddad.

590
01:27:48,283 --> 01:27:50,808
The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

591
01:27:50,952 --> 01:27:52,613
I have the result

592
01:27:52,754 --> 01:27:54,688
that you have requested
via email.

593
01:27:54,823 --> 01:27:57,451
Simon my file on
the seat beside you.

594
01:27:57,592 --> 01:28:00,425
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?

595
01:28:00,529 --> 01:28:03,464
You are very nice, but the
delay and everything ...

596
01:28:03,598 --> 01:28:05,862
I think I'll wait until later.

597
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:07,195
But I'll summarize.

598
01:28:07,335 --> 01:28:08,962
For the father, it is
rather difficult

599
01:28:09,137 --> 01:28:11,037
because I can not find
the death certificate.

600
01:28:11,173 --> 01:28:12,140
For the brother ...

601
01:28:12,274 --> 01:28:14,139
Excuse me, but what
are we talking about here?

602
01:28:14,309 --> 01:28:15,970
I asked for help, Simon.

603
01:28:16,144 --> 01:28:18,874
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand

604
01:28:19,014 --> 01:28:20,345
to speed things up.

605
01:28:20,482 --> 01:28:23,781
I told you, Jean,
we came for Jeanne.

606
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:27,815
Your sister is the one person
in your family

607
01:28:27,989 --> 01:28:29,388
easiest to find.

608
01:28:36,565 --> 01:28:39,033
I'm so glad you're here.

609
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:41,328
Me too.

610
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:49,844
OK, that's the nurse's name.

611
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:51,842
which helped your mother give birth
in prison.

612
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,538
We can go today.

613
01:28:54,549 --> 01:28:56,847
Jeanne, that's enough.

614
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,688
No, you shut up, then follow me.

615
01:29:00,856 --> 01:29:03,757
It's your job to find our
brother, not mine!

616
01:29:03,892 --> 01:29:06,190
Then, if you don't do it for
her or for you,

617
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:08,056
the, do it for me!

618
01:29:14,236 --> 01:29:16,033
She is at the American hospital.

619
01:29:22,177 --> 01:29:23,940
I'm glad you're here, Jean.

620
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:26,013
Me too, my owl, me too.

621
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:29,380
If she is sleeping, you must return
later.

622
01:29:53,808 --> 01:29:55,298
Ms. Maika?

623
01:30:24,066 --> 01:30:27,229
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.

624
01:30:27,403 --> 01:30:28,768
Bonjour, Madame!

625
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:30,394
Thank you for having us.

626
01:30:30,572 --> 01:30:33,405
We seek someone you know.

627
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:35,772
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?

628
01:31:03,939 --> 01:31:06,806
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison
as a nurse?

629
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,588
She says she knows your mom.

630
01:31:24,793 --> 01:31:27,023
You helped our mother
give birth in prison?

631
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:32,964
Yes.

632
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:43,305
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.

633
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:44,878
Can you help us?

634
01:31:48,517 --> 01:31:51,850
She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

635
01:31:52,988 --> 01:31:55,548
She assisted her
during childbirth.

636
01:31:56,992 --> 01:31:58,983
She gathered the children.

637
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:08,463
Then she gave them back
to the woman who sings

638
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:10,504
when she got out of prison.

639
01:32:11,707 --> 01:32:13,834
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

640
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:18,212
Hush, hush, hush.

641
01:32:20,315 --> 01:32:22,180
Hush, hush, hush.

642
01:36:28,764 --> 01:36:31,426
You really know the
woman who sings?

643
01:36:31,566 --> 01:36:34,592
You don't know what
it means to me.

644
01:36:35,771 --> 01:36:37,739
Nawal Marwan worked for me

645
01:36:37,839 --> 01:36:39,431
as a secretary for 18 years.

646
01:36:39,574 --> 01:36:41,804
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

647
01:36:41,943 --> 01:36:43,433
to her and her children.

648
01:36:44,446 --> 01:36:45,777
But I confess that I

649
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:48,438
didn't really know her till the end.

650
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,280
- Ready?
- Ready.

651
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:06,823
Hmm ...

652
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,961
Me Maddadi has conducted an
investigation, at my request,

653
01:37:11,139 --> 01:37:14,302
to track your brother
and your father.

654
01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:21,442
For the father, Abu Tarek,

655
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:24,314
I still have not found
a death certificate.

656
01:37:24,486 --> 01:37:26,613
The country has a lot
of certificates missing.

657
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:28,951
He could have gone abroad.

658
01:37:29,057 --> 01:37:32,356
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

659
01:37:32,494 --> 01:37:33,893
They are dead or have disappeared.

660
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:35,155
You have to see.

661
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,491
Maybe it's better that way.

662
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:40,899
For the brother ...

663
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:43,334
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

664
01:37:43,471 --> 01:37:45,336
comes from the village
of Der Om.

665
01:37:45,507 --> 01:37:49,739
She gave the child to a midwife
who's named Elham

666
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:53,678
who herself returned it to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

667
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:56,181
in May 1970.

668
01:37:57,519 --> 01:38:00,386
The main task was to
trace the registry records.

669
01:38:00,522 --> 01:38:03,082
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

670
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:06,686
But I found the records

671
01:38:06,828 --> 01:38:09,092
which were recovered and donated

672
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:13,361
by the Sisters of Charity
to the National Archives.

673
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:17,198
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham

674
01:38:17,372 --> 01:38:20,205
filed a petition for adoption
of a male child.

675
01:38:20,342 --> 01:38:25,006
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed in that month.

676
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:26,444
Look.

677
01:38:26,581 --> 01:38:29,744
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

678
01:38:31,586 --> 01:38:33,713
The dates match.

679
01:38:33,855 --> 01:38:35,345
That's him.

680
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:39,521
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

681
01:38:43,064 --> 01:38:45,055
Orphanage Kfar Kout,

682
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,258
Nihad May.

683
01:38:46,401 --> 01:38:49,461
It's his name in the registry.

684
01:38:49,604 --> 01:38:50,798
Nihad from the month of May.

685
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:53,373
They gave him a temporary name

686
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:54,806
with the month of arrival.

687
01:38:54,943 --> 01:38:57,969
There was no adoption
during that period.

688
01:38:58,113 --> 01:38:59,910
It was the beginning of the war.

689
01:39:00,081 --> 01:39:02,811
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

690
01:39:04,085 --> 01:39:06,747
We must ask those that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

691
01:39:06,888 --> 01:39:09,755
to know what happened
to the children.

692
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,423
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

693
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:17,921
there is not much hope.

694
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:21,426
They are probably also dead.

695
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:23,628
I'm not saying they're dead.

696
01:39:23,772 --> 01:39:25,899
I say we lost track of them.

697
01:39:27,609 --> 01:39:29,440
They are both dead.

698
01:39:29,577 --> 01:39:32,011
We open the envelopes,
that's it, then.

699
01:39:32,147 --> 01:39:33,978
That I will not allow, Simon.

700
01:39:34,115 --> 01:39:35,946
This kind of thing is sacred.

701
01:39:39,788 --> 01:39:41,983
Luckily, I have a history.

702
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:46,786
Excuse me.

703
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,523
It is still worth exploring.

704
01:39:50,665 --> 01:39:53,930
But it is a little radical.

705
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:55,937
The warlord

706
01:39:56,037 --> 01:39:58,665
that demolished the orphanage
at that time is still alive.

707
01:39:58,807 --> 01:40:00,866
And he may know what happened

708
01:40:01,009 --> 01:40:03,204
to Nihad's children and where
they went.

709
01:40:03,345 --> 01:40:04,539
It's already been an eternity.

710
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:06,340
You must understand

711
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:09,678
that during this period there were
a series of reprisals

712
01:40:09,818 --> 01:40:13,345
which fit one another in
a sort of inexorable logic,

713
01:40:17,325 --> 01:40:19,293
A warlord is exactly

714
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:21,555
the type of man who
has a long memory.

715
01:40:21,696 --> 01:40:24,028
And he will remember, believe me.

716
01:40:25,467 --> 01:40:27,298
Wallat Chamseddine,

717
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:28,835
is his name.

718
01:40:33,141 --> 01:40:34,506
We can find him here?

719
01:40:34,642 --> 01:40:37,634
If we don't find him, he
will find us.

720
01:40:40,515 --> 01:40:42,540
But we can try something.

721
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:47,048
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

722
01:40:51,059 --> 01:40:53,027
It's your turn.

723
01:40:56,498 --> 01:40:58,227
You will go

724
01:40:58,366 --> 01:41:00,357
to the Deressa refugee camp.

725
01:41:00,535 --> 01:41:02,002
You will come to tea

726
01:41:02,103 --> 01:41:03,365
anywhere in the camp

727
01:41:03,538 --> 01:41:05,403
with the person that invite you.

728
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:08,532
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

729
01:41:08,676 --> 01:41:10,541
and are looking Nihad May.

730
01:41:10,712 --> 01:41:12,839
You can not go there alone.

731
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:16,208
I'll find someone

732
01:41:16,351 --> 01:41:17,875
to accompany you.

733
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:41,737
Welcome to Deressa.

734
01:42:50,311 --> 01:42:52,142
Ha! Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

735
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:53,712
I know.

736
01:43:20,074 --> 01:43:21,302
How are you?

737
01:43:22,644 --> 01:43:24,134
In the name of God, you've grown!

738
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:27,076
I have finished my engineering studies.

739
01:43:27,248 --> 01:43:31,878
I cannot find work, so I'm
a taxi driver now.

740
01:43:32,053 --> 01:43:34,078
What brings you here?

741
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:39,318
I am with some foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

742
01:43:41,196 --> 01:43:43,061
Welcome, come.

743
01:43:43,231 --> 01:43:45,563
No, thank you, we're
in a hurry.

744
01:43:45,733 --> 01:43:47,564
Please, come.

745
01:43:52,874 --> 01:43:55,604
He is inviting us to tea.

746
01:43:55,743 --> 01:43:56,869
Oh, good!

747
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:17,929
Uh, I wonder why you have
come to Deressa.

748
01:44:21,069 --> 01:44:23,560
I am looking for someone
named Nihad de Mai.

749
01:44:32,914 --> 01:44:35,906
He does not know Nihad de Mai.

750
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:39,247
He asks me what are your names.

751
01:44:46,594 --> 01:44:49,427
My mother comes from the village
of Der de Om, in the South.

752
01:45:02,677 --> 01:45:04,770
My mother is the woman who sings.

753
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:32,264
Yes, that's fine. Done.

754
01:45:37,445 --> 01:45:39,003
Wait for what?

755
01:46:12,347 --> 01:46:14,315
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

756
01:46:14,415 --> 01:46:16,747
We are here to offer help.

757
01:46:16,884 --> 01:46:19,182
You will be back in an hour.

758
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:21,911
Can I tell my sister?

759
01:46:22,056 --> 01:46:25,082
No, you'll be back in
an hour, I promise.

760
01:46:26,561 --> 01:46:29,029
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.

761
01:46:31,833 --> 01:46:33,027
He will call.

762
01:46:33,401 --> 01:46:34,766
He's going to go.

763
01:46:35,436 --> 01:46:38,269
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.

764
01:46:38,406 --> 01:46:41,842
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

765
01:46:42,043 --> 01:46:43,442
Oh, okay.

766
01:47:57,685 --> 01:48:00,950
You have been luck with us,
we'll help in our own way.

767
01:48:02,323 --> 01:48:03,847
You must leave the country.

768
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:05,754
It'll be easier.

769
01:48:05,927 --> 01:48:08,361
We will find you a house and a job.

770
01:48:09,297 --> 01:48:12,289
I want your life to be better.

771
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:16,865
We have many contacts
in America.

772
01:48:18,673 --> 01:48:20,868
You gotta go with your children.

773
01:48:21,476 --> 01:48:24,309
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

774
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:31,145
The children will help
you, you'll see.

775
01:48:37,959 --> 01:48:40,894
You cannot ask me.

776
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:45,028
Your children are our
children, Nawal.

777
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,326
Your family is our family.

778
01:48:47,835 --> 01:48:49,029
Trust me.

779
01:48:50,471 --> 01:48:53,406
I'll help you.

780
01:48:53,574 --> 01:48:56,907
I'm here for you and
your children.

781
01:49:46,427 --> 01:49:47,917
Hello, Sarwan.

782
01:49:50,064 --> 01:49:53,727
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

783
01:49:55,903 --> 01:49:58,804
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

784
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:05,542
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

785
01:50:07,281 --> 01:50:09,044
You knew my mother.

786
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:11,778
They say she worked for me.

787
01:50:11,919 --> 01:50:14,945
What can I do to help?

788
01:50:18,926 --> 01:50:22,259
I am looking for a
man named Nihad de Mai.

789
01:50:23,297 --> 01:50:25,424
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?

790
01:50:27,435 --> 01:50:28,493
He's my brother.

791
01:50:28,636 --> 01:50:31,127
My mother asked me to find him.

792
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,671
And how can you prove that

793
01:50:34,809 --> 01:50:37,835
Nihad de Mai is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

794
01:50:40,615 --> 01:50:42,412
My brother was
placed for adoption

795
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:44,279
at the Kfar Kout orphanage.

796
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,589
We found the registry with
the original file.

797
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,251
The dates ... Everything fits.

798
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:53,589
Nihad de Mai is my brother.

799
01:51:36,837 --> 01:51:38,896
Me and my friends, we attacked

800
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,372
the christian village at Kfar Kout ...

801
01:51:42,376 --> 01:51:43,843
In response to attacks

802
01:51:44,011 --> 01:51:46,844
that our brothers, the refugees,
were victims of.

803
01:51:48,482 --> 01:51:51,576
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

804
01:51:52,653 --> 01:51:54,712
I saved the children.

805
01:51:54,855 --> 01:51:56,982
I took them with us.

806
01:51:57,091 --> 01:51:59,992
And Nihad was among them.

807
01:52:00,094 --> 01:52:02,028
We have trained and prepared

808
01:52:02,196 --> 01:52:04,391
them so that they can fight
alongside us.

809
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,863
Nihad, he had a gift.

810
01:52:08,035 --> 01:52:10,526
He was at unique.

811
01:52:10,705 --> 01:52:13,868
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

812
01:52:15,176 --> 01:52:19,704
But he wanted to
find her mother.

813
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,848
He sought her for a long time.

814
01:52:23,284 --> 01:52:26,549
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

815
01:52:27,555 --> 01:52:29,045
He started ...

816
01:52:30,224 --> 01:52:32,556
a crazy war.

817
01:52:32,727 --> 01:52:36,629
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

818
01:52:36,764 --> 01:52:39,232
so that his mother should see
his picture everywhere

819
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,697
on the walls around the country.

820
01:52:41,936 --> 01:52:43,563
But I refused.

821
01:52:45,473 --> 01:52:47,464
He went back to Daresh.

822
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:50,703
He became a maverick,

823
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:53,075
one of the most dangerous  in the region.

824
01:52:53,247 --> 01:52:54,441
A real machine.

825
01:52:54,582 --> 01:52:56,447
He pulls on everyone.

826
01:52:56,584 --> 01:53:00,987
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

827
01:53:02,389 --> 01:53:03,879
And one morning ...

828
01:53:04,892 --> 01:53:06,826
They captured Nihad.

829
01:53:06,961 --> 01:53:08,758
He killed seven gunmen.

830
01:53:10,831 --> 01:53:12,594
They did not killed them.

831
01:53:12,733 --> 01:53:14,098
They captured him

832
01:53:14,235 --> 01:53:16,931
and sent him to the prison
in Kfar Ryat.

833
01:53:18,305 --> 01:53:20,000
He has been in prison?

834
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:21,608
Yes.

835
01:53:23,978 --> 01:53:25,411
He is the executioner.

836
01:53:27,581 --> 01:53:29,481
He worked with my father?

837
01:53:29,617 --> 01:53:31,585
- No, he did not work

838
01:53:31,685 --> 01:53:33,619
with Abu Tarek, your father.

839
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:04,117
- Are you okay?

840
01:54:08,789 --> 01:54:10,279
One plus one ...

841
01:54:11,292 --> 01:54:13,157
that makes two.

842
01:54:13,294 --> 01:54:14,784
What?

843
01:54:17,832 --> 01:54:19,891
One plus one makes two.

844
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:22,391
You can not make one.

845
01:54:29,009 --> 01:54:30,806
Hey, you have a fever.

846
01:54:33,214 --> 01:54:34,704
Jeanne?

847
01:54:36,584 --> 01:54:39,212
One plus one, does it make one?

848
01:55:00,875 --> 01:55:02,740
Are there are empty seats, no.

849
01:55:02,877 --> 01:55:04,208
Oh, move ahead if you want.

850
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,366
Can I help you, ma'am?

851
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:45,478
Excuse me.

852
01:57:55,849 --> 01:57:58,215
<i>By becoming a hangman

853
01:57:58,352 --> 01:58:00,843

Mr. Harmanni?

860
01:59:04,151 --> 01:59:05,118
Yes?

861
01:59:12,626 --> 01:59:14,116
This is for you.

862
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:02,836
<i>My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.

863
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,568
<i>I recognized you.

864
02:00:04,711 --> 02:00:07,339
<i>But you didn't.

865
02:00:07,514 --> 02:00:09,379
<i>It's a wonderful miracle.

866
02:00:09,516 --> 02:00:11,177
<i>I'm your number 72.

867
02:00:11,318 --> 02:00:15,584
<i>This letter will be delivered
by our children.

02:00:15,722 --> 02:00:17,713
<i>You will not recognize them

869
02:00:17,858 --> 02:00:19,689
<i>because they are beautiful,

870
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:22,192

871
02:00:30,871 --> 02:00:33,101

<i>I know.

875
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,042
<i>Because silence is
all to the truth.

888
02:01:34,401 --> 02:01:36,835

02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:55,341
<i>When you were born?

907
02:02:55,515 --> 02:02:57,710
<i>Then she starts in horror.

908
02:02:58,919 --> 02:03:02,047
<i>At the birth of your father?

909
02:03:02,189 --> 02:03:05,386
<i>Then she begins a
great love story.

910
02:03:07,427 --> 02:03:10,919
<i>I say that your story
begins with a promise

911
02:03:11,064 --> 02:03:13,498
<i>that will break
the thread of anger.

912
02:03:15,369 --> 02:03:18,702
<i>Thanks to you, today I finally
managed to do it.

913
02:03:18,872 --> 02:03:20,840
<i>The thread is broken.

914
02:03:20,941 --> 02:03:23,876
<i>And I can finally take
the time to rock you in my arms...

915
02:03:25,245 --> 02:03:27,406
and softly sing you a lullaby

916
02:03:27,547 --> 02:03:29,412
<i>to comfort you.

917
02:03:29,549 --> 02:03:32,177
<i>Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.

918
02:03:34,054 --> 02:03:35,544
<i>I love you.

919
02:03:36,923 --> 02:03:40,086
<i>Your mother, Nawal.
